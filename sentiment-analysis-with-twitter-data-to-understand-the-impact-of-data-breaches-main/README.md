# Sentiment Analysis with Twitter Data to Understand the Impact of Data Breaches

## Analysis of Data Breaches
This project analyzes tweets related to recent data breaches at four major companies, namely Marriott, Chegg, UnderArmour, and T-Mobile. The objective of the project is to use a supervised or unsupervised learning algorithm to gain insights into the impact of data breaches on these companies.

## Data Loading and Cleaning
The first step in the project is to load and clean the tweet data for analysis. The code for this step is provided in the Data Loading and Data Cleaning section of the code file. The data is loaded from a CSV file and duplicate tweets are removed. Irrelevant columns are dropped and NaN values are replaced with an empty string. Retweets are also removed, and a function is defined to clean the tweet text by removing URLs, mentions, special characters, and converting the text to lowercase.

## Analysis
Once the data is cleaned, the next step is to apply a supervised or unsupervised learning algorithm to gain insights into the impact of data breaches on the four companies. The specific algorithm used will depend on the research question being investigated and the nature of the data. The results of the analysis will be presented in the research paper.

## Research Paper
The research paper for this project will be a substantial proportion of the coursework marks and should be a unique submission that has not been previously submitted. The paper should follow the format outlined inthe requirements document provided in the task. This includes an introduction, literature review, methodology, results, and discussion sections. The paper should also include a clear research question and objectives, as well as a detailed description of the supervised or unsupervised learning algorithm used for the analysis.

## Optional Topic
This year's optional big data topic is the analysis of data breaches. The project focuses on analyzing tweets related to data breaches at four major companies, but students are also permitted to undertake a suitable research project that makes use of the supervised and/or unsupervised learning techniques covered in the module.
