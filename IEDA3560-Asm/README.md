# IEDA3560 Coursework Assignments

This repository contains coursework and assignment solutions for the course **IEDA3560: Perscriptive Analytics**.

## Structure
- Each subfolder (e.g., `Asm 1`, `Asm 2`, ...) contains the code and data for a specific assignment.
- All code has been refactored for clarity, modularity, and best practices (PEP8 compliance, type hints, docstrings, and main blocks).
- All Jupyter notebooks have been removed; only improved Python scripts remain.

## How to Use
- Each assignment can be run as a standalone Python script.
- Required dependencies: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and (for some assignments) `seaborn` and `scipy`.
- To install all dependencies, run:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn scipy
  ```

## Assignments Included
- Linear regression, feature engineering, and model selection
- Cross-validation and greedy algorithms
- Decision trees, SVM, k-NN, and PCA
- Real-world datasets (e.g., Titanic, automobile, cryptocurrency)

## Notes
- All scripts are ready to run and have been improved for readability and maintainability.
- Data files required for each assignment should be placed in the corresponding subfolder.
