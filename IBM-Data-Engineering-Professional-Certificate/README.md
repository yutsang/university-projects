## About The Course <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/IBM%20Cloud-1261FE?style=for-the-badge&logo=IBM%20Cloud&logoColor=white"/>

This Professional Certificate from IBM on Coursera is designed for individuals who are interested in pursuing a career as a data engineer. The program provides self-paced online courses that offer hands-on experience with a variety of tools and databases, enabling learners to design, deploy, and manage both structured and unstructured data.

Upon completion of the program, learners will be equipped with the essential skills required to perform the key tasks of a data engineering role. These skills include using Python programming language and Linux/UNIX shell scripts for ETL tasks, working with Relational Databases (RDBMS) and querying data using SQL statements, utilizing NoSQL databases and unstructured data, and gaining an introduction to Big Data and working with engines like Hadoop and Spark. Additionally, learners will gain experience in creating Data Warehouses and using Business Intelligence tools to analyze and extract insights.
