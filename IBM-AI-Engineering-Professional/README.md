About the Course

The IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate program on Coursera provides learners with practical skills in AI and machine learning engineering and deployment. Throughout the series of online courses, learners will gain hands-on experience using IBM Cloud services and open source tools to build and deploy AI applications.
The program covers topics including exploratory data analysis, machine learning pipelines, deep learning models, natural language processing, computer vision, and practical deployment of AI models. Learners will work with frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn to build models, and integrate them into applications with IBM Watson Assistant and other services.
Upon completing the program, learners will have the skills required for an entry-level role in AI Engineering. The certificate can showcase their ability to develop AI models, optimize performance, and deploy them responsibly.
For those interested in becoming AI Engineers or furthering their skills in the field, the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate provides valuable, hands-on learning.

## How to Use

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Open `.ipynb` files in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VSCode).
- **Python Files**: For converted large notebooks, run `.py` files directly with Python:
  - `Capstone/Evaluating and Testing Pre-trained Models.py` - Pre-trained model evaluation (converted from large notebook)
  - `3.Intriduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing/Stop-sign-not-stop-sign-CNN.py` - CNN for stop sign detection (converted from large notebook)
- Explore code, run cells/scripts, and review results for each course module or assignment.
- Certificates and badges are in the `Certs/` folder for reference.
