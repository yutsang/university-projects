# Audio Analysis Matlab Project

This repository contains MATLAB code for audio signal analysis, modulation/demodulation, and communication protocol simulation. The project is organized into three main parts, each focusing on different aspects of audio and signal processing.

## Folder Structure

- **Part 1/**: Basic audio frame analysis and approximation
- **Part 2/**: Modulation and demodulation of audio signals
- **Part 3/**: Communication protocol simulation (ALOHA)

## Input Data
- `Part 1/test.wav`: Example speech waveform for analysis
- `Part 2/lab07_speech*.wav`: Example speech waveforms for modulation/demodulation
- `Part 3/frames.mat`: Data for protocol simulation

## Usage
1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the desired part's folder.
2. Run the main script for each part:
   - **Part 1**: `Lab6_Task1.m`, `Lab6_Task2.m`, `Lab6_Task3.m`, `Lab6_Task4.m`
   - **Part 2**: `Lab7_task1.m`, `Lab7_task2.m`, `Lab7_task3.m`, `Lab7_task4.m`
   - **Part 3**: `Lab8_task1.m`, `Lab8_task2.m`, `Lab8_task3.m`, `Lab8_task4.m`
3. Ensure the required input data files are present in each folder.

## File Descriptions
- `.m` files: Main scripts and functions for each task
- `.p` files: Precompiled MATLAB functions (source not included)
- `.wav` files: Audio input data
- `.mat` files: MATLAB data files

## Notes
- The code is written for educational purposes and may require the Signal Processing Toolbox.
- For best results, use the latest version of MATLAB.

## Cleaning and Maintenance
- Unnecessary system files (e.g., `.DS_Store`) have been removed.
- Only essential code and input data are retained in each part.
